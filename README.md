Fighting-Game-Command-Interpreter
=================================

This project is playground project in Haskell. Currently learning Haskell, and passionate of fighting game, i wanted to understand better what's happening behind the scene when I try to perform combo's.

The way it behaves now is pretty close to Street Fighter, the 1st. It's simple, so if you want to do special move, you should not miss the command otherwise this wont be recognize.
